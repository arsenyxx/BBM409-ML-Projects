# BBM409 - Machine Learning Laboratory Projects

This repository contains coursework from the **Spring 2025 BBM409: Machine Learning Laboratory** course at Hacettepe University, focusing on hands-on implementation of core machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python.

## üìÅ Contents

### Assignment 2 ‚Äì Financial Risk Classification using Decision Trees
- Implemented a decision tree classifier using the **ID3 algorithm** from scratch.
- Developed a model to predict financial risk ratings (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) using a dataset with 19 features.
- Handled **missing data**, implemented **pruning** to reduce overfitting, and evaluated the model using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Extracted and explained **root-to-leaf decision paths** for model interpretability.

### Assignment 3 ‚Äì Sentiment Classification using Naive Bayes
- Implemented a **Naive Bayes text classifier** from scratch using **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** with unigrams and bigrams.
- Trained on a dataset of 72,500 Amazon product reviews labeled by star ratings.
- Calculated performance metrics and explored various preprocessing strategies (e.g., stopword removal, TF-IDF).
- As a **bonus**, implemented a comparison using **Word Embedding (Word2Vec/Glove) + Logistic Regression** to contrast traditional methods with neural approaches.

## üõ† Technologies
- Python 3.9
- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Manual implementation of ID3 and Naive Bayes
- Scikit-learn (only for train/test split and confusion matrix)

## üìå Notes
- All models and algorithms were implemented **from scratch**, without using libraries like Scikit-learn or NLTK for core logic.
- Each assignment includes a well-documented and executable Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).
- Report files include explanations of methodology, preprocessing, and model performance.
